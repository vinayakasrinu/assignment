# Dataset Information

The dataset used to train the model was downloaded from the [FGVC Aircraft Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/fgvc-aircraft/) provided by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford.

## Dataset Description

The FGVC Aircraft Dataset is a large-scale dataset consisting of images of aircraft belonging to 100 aircraft families. It is commonly used for fine-grained visual categorization tasks in computer vision research.

## Data Files

- `train.csv`: Contains the mapping of image paths to labels for the training set.
- `test.csv`: Contains the mapping of image paths to labels for the test set.
- `val.csv`: Contains the mapping of image paths to labels for the validation set.
